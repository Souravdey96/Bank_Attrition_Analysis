# Bank Attrition Analysis — Milestone 1

This project explores customer attrition (churn) using the `bank_dataset_v2.csv` dataset. The goal is to understand patterns between customers who **stayed** vs those who **exited**.

## Overview
- Cleaned and preprocessed customer data  
- Performed univariate, bivariate, and segment-wise analysis  
- Compared churn behavior using features like salary, products, tenure, card type, and satisfaction score  
- Added simple feature engineering (salary categories, tenure-based metrics)

## Key Insights
- Salary, number of products, and tenure show clear differences between exited vs stayed customers  
- Certain customer segments exhibit higher attrition risk based on complaints, satisfaction, and financial behaviour  

## Tech Stack
Python · Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Seaborn

## How to Run
Open the notebook and run all cells in order.
